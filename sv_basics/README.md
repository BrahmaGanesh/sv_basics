# SystemVerilog Basics 🚀

This repository provides a clean, beginner-friendly collection of SystemVerilog modules along with a coding style guide. It's designed to help students, interns, and entry-level engineers learn and follow consistent design practices.

## 📁 Project Structure

| File              | Description                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `style_guide.md`  | SystemVerilog coding conventions             |
| `counter.sv`      | Parameterized up-counter                     |
| `mux2to1.sv`      | Parameterized 2-to-1 multiplexer             |
| `...`             | More modules coming daily (DFF, ALU, FSM...) |

---

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Promote clean and reusable SV coding
- ✅ Provide example modules that are easy to simulate and learn
- ✅ Build a strong foundation for ASIC/FPGA/VLSI roles

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Refer to `style_guide.md` to follow consistent code practices
2. Explore each module (`.sv`) and simulate with your own testbenches
3. Clone the repo and contribute with improvements if desired!

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered (So Far)

- `always_ff` for synchronous logic
- `always_comb` for combinational logic
- Parameterized modules
- Active-low reset convention
- Multiplexers and counters

---

## 📌 Upcoming Modules

- D Flip-Flop with async reset
- Decoders, Encoders, FSMs
- ALU, Shift Registers, Arbiters
