|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `style_guide.md`    | SystemVerilog coding conventions             |
| `counter.sv`        | Parameterized up-counter                     |
| `mux2to1.sv`        | Parameterized 2-to-1 multiplexer             |
| `dff_async.sv`      | D Flip-Flop with asynchronous active-low reset |
| `decoder_3to8.sv`   | 3-to-8 binary decoder                        |
| `...`               | More modules coming daily (Encoders, FSMs...)|

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Promote clean and reusable SV coding
- ✅ Provide example modules that are easy to simulate and learn
- ✅ Build a strong foundation for ASIC/FPGA/VLSI roles

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Refer to `style_guide.md` to follow consistent code practices
2. Explore each module (`.sv`) and simulate with your own testbenches
3. Clone the repo and contribute with improvements if desired!

## 🧠 Concepts Covered (So Far)

- `always_ff` for synchronous logic
- `always_comb` for combinational logic
- Parameterized modules
- Active-low reset convention
- Multiplexers, counters, flip-flops, decoders

---

## 📌 Upcoming Modules

- Encoders, Priority Encoders
- FSMs (Traffic Light Controller)
- ALU, Shift Registers, Arbiters
