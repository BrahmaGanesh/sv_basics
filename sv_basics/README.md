## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Promote clean and reusable SV coding
- ✅ Provide example modules that are easy to simulate and learn
- ✅ Build a strong foundation for ASIC/FPGA/VLSI roles

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Refer to `style_guide.md` to follow consistent code practices
2. Explore each module (`.sv`) and simulate with your own testbenches
3. Clone the repo and contribute with improvements if desired!

## 🧠 Concepts Covered (So Far)

- `always_ff` for synchronous logic
- `always_comb` for combinational logic
- Parameterized modules
- Active-low reset convention
- Multiplexers, counters, flip-flops, decoders, encoders

---

## 📌 Upcoming Modules

- FSMs (Traffic Light Controller)
- ALU, Shift Registers, Arbiters
